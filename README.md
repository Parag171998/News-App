# News-App
I'm using news api to fetch country sfecific news. I'm showing ads and notification in the app.
Video app = https://drive.google.com/file/d/12y-BIO8T2AZK84OIHrUsLsHhG925YE5K/view?usp=sharing

In greedygame branch, I'm using java and MVVM architecture. I'm using a webview to show full news articles.
Also, I'm storing news in-room database, so if a user is not connected to a network, the app will fetch news from the room database.
